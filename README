Version 1.1.5 of the Qt bindings for Haskell, a set of Haskell bindings for the
Qt library from Trolltech.  There are no subtantial changes to the code, but it
now compiles with GHC 7.6 (and possibly with newer versions of GHC).

There was a bug related to the Foreign Function Interface. In most cases that
could be resolved by importing Foreign.C.Types, but not always.  I introduced a
couple of extra changes to make things compile, but there is no guarantee that
they will work. Actually, I would expect them to break. Please, try them, and
if you can find a better solution, send a msg or a pull request.

Html Documentation for this project can be found in the 'doc' folder.
The qtHaskell User Guide includes comprehensive installation instructions.
See examples/ and demos/ for code examples.

Note: I had to modify the scripts to make it work with cabal sandboxes and to
install files in a local directory and not /usr/local/. It's not portable, just
customised. Let me know if you want to have access to that build.pl script.

Regarding the old version:

The original version of this library used to be hosted here:
http://qthaskell.berlios.de
That website no longer exists.
